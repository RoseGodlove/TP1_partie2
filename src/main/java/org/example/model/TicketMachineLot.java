 * Ticket machines available for opening (the company owns two of them without further acquisitions foreseen). Once a machine is opened, it cannot be closed.
 * @learning It is ok for the model to hold the isMachine2Demanded attribute, because the model will change with same cycles as controllers (and you can substitute them without changing the model). Command line would still work but ex. a previous command would be needed to open second machine before command to use second machine would be functional, or opening could be used whenever command is used.
